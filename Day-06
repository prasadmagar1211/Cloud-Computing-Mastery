# Day 6: Cloud Deployment Models

### 🚀 Daily Update
Today I am studying how cloud infrastructure is deployed and who has access to it. 
While Service Models (SaaS/PaaS/IaaS) define *what* is being delivered, Deployment Models define *where* the infrastructure resides and *who* has control over it.

### 🟢 The 4 Primary Deployment Models

#### 1. Public Cloud
* **Definition:** The cloud infrastructure is made available to the general public over the internet and is owned by a cloud service provider.
* **Key Features:** Multi-tenancy, pay-as-you-go, no maintenance.
* **Examples:** AWS, Azure, Google Cloud.

#### 2. Private Cloud
* **Definition:** The infrastructure is operated solely for a single organization. It can be managed by the organization itself or a third party.
* **Key Features:** High security, complete control, and dedicated resources.
* **Examples:** OpenStack, VMware, Microsoft Azure Stack.

#### 3. Hybrid Cloud
* **Definition:** A combination of two or more clouds (Private, Community, or Public) that remain unique entities but are bound together.
* **Key Features:** Allows "Cloud Bursting"—using the public cloud to handle traffic spikes while keeping sensitive data on a private cloud.

#### 4. Community Cloud
* **Definition:** The infrastructure is shared by several organizations that have shared concerns (e.g., security, compliance, or jurisdiction).
* **Key Features:** Costs are spread over a smaller group of users than a public cloud, but it offers more privacy.

### 📊 Comparison Matrix

| Feature | Public Cloud | Private Cloud | Hybrid Cloud |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost** | Low (OpEx) | High (CapEx) | Moderate |
| **Control** | Low | Very High | Flexible |
| **Security** | Moderate | Very High | High |
| **Scalability** | Near-Infinite | Limited | High |

### 💡 Key Takeaway
The choice of a deployment model depends on the organization's specific needs for **Budget**, **Security**, and **Compliance**. 
Most modern enterprises are shifting toward a **Hybrid** strategy to balance cost and control.
