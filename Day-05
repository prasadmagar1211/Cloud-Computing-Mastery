# Day 5: Complete Roadmap to Cloud Computing 

### 🚀 Daily Update
Today is about the "Big Picture." Following the Gate Smashers Lecture 5, 
I am documenting the full roadmap to becoming a Cloud Engineer. 
It’s not just about knowing one provider like AWS or Azure; it’s about understanding the underlying architecture and the sequence of learning required to master the domain.

### 🟢 The Learning Path (Roadmap)

To master Cloud Computing, one must progress through these specific stages:

1. **Foundations (The "Why" and "What"):**
   - History, Evolution, NIST Characteristics, and Benefits.
   - Understanding Virtualization (The backbone of Cloud).

2. **Architecture & Models:**
   - Service Models: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS.
   - Deployment Models: Public, Private, Hybrid, Community.

3. **Cloud Infrastructure Components:**
   - **Compute:** Virtual Machines, Containers (Docker/K8s).
   - **Storage:** Object, Block, and File storage.
   - **Networking:** VPC, Subnets, Load Balancers, Route Tables.
   - **Database:** SQL vs NoSQL in the Cloud.

4. **Advanced Operations:**
   - Cloud Security (IAM, Encryption).
   - Cost Optimization & Monitoring.
   - Disaster Recovery & Backup.



### 💎 Key Career Roles in Cloud
* **Cloud Architect:** Designing the overall infrastructure and choosing the right services.
* **Cloud Engineer:** Deploying and managing the resources.
* **Cloud Security Specialist:** Ensuring data privacy and compliance.
* **DevOps Engineer:** Automating the deployment pipeline using cloud tools.

### 💡 Key Takeaway
A roadmap is essential to avoid "Tutorial Hell." By following a structured path—starting from the hardware abstraction (Virtualization) 
to the high-level services (SaaS)—I can build a mental model that applies to any cloud provider, whether it's AWS, GCP, or Azure.
