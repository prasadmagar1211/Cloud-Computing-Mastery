# Day 1: Introduction to Cloud Computing 

### 🚀 Starting My Journey
Today I am officially launching my 43-day cloud computing streak. My objective is to master the architecture, 
deployment models, and virtualization techniques that power modern scalable applications. 
This repository will document my daily progress, technical insights, and hands-on implementations.

### 🟢 Concept Overview
Cloud Computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources (compute, storage, databases) via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. 
It eliminates the need to manage physical hardware.

### 🔑 Core Pillars (NIST Model)
* **On-Demand Self-Service:** Provision resources instantly without human intervention.
* **Broad Network Access:** Services are accessible over the network via standard mechanisms.
* **Resource Pooling:** Computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers (Multi-tenancy).
* **Rapid Elasticity:** Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released to scale rapidly with demand.
* **Measured Service:** Resource usage is automatically monitored and controlled for transparent billing.

### 📊 Comparison: On-Premise vs. Cloud
| Feature | On-Premise IT | Cloud Computing |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost Model** | CapEx (High Upfront) | OpEx (Pay-as-you-use) |
| **Agility** | Low (Weeks to deploy) | High (Minutes to deploy) |
| **Scalability** | Manual & Limited | Automated & Infinite |
| **Maintenance** | In-house Responsibility | Provider Managed |

### 💡 Key Takeaway
The transition to cloud is a shift from **Physical Infrastructure** to **Software-Defined Infrastructure**. 
It allows developers to focus on code and innovation rather than hardware procurement and data center maintenance.
