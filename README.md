# Cloud Computing Mastery

Welcome to my Cloud Computing Mastery repository. This project is a dedicated learning sprint designed to build a deep technical foundation in cloud architecture, virtualization, and distributed systems.

### 🎯 Objectives
* **Foundational Knowledge:** Mastering NIST models, service layers (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), and deployment strategies.
* **Virtualization:** Deep dive into Hypervisors, Containerization (VMs vs Docker), and Resource Abstraction.
* **Infrastructure:** Understanding Cloud Storage (Object/Block), Networking (VPC/SDN), and Security (IAM).
* **Industry Readiness:** Documenting theoretical concepts and mapping them to real-world cloud provider services.

### 📈 The Roadmap
Each module corresponds to a specific topic in the cloud engineering curriculum. Every folder in this repository contains a `README.md` with technical summaries, architectural diagrams, and key takeaways.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Concepts
* **Architectures:** Multi-tenancy, Microservices, Serverless.
* **Storage:** SAN, NAS, Object Storage, DBaaS.
* **Networking:** Load Balancing, CDN, SDN, VPC.
* **Security:** Encryption, Shared Responsibility Model, Governance.
